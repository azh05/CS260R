    "## Section 3: Implement Deep Q Learning in Pytorch\n",
    "\n",
    "(30 / 100 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will implement a neural network and train it with Deep Q Learning via Pytorch, a powerful deep learning framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with Pytorch, we suggest you to go through pytorch official quickstart tutorials:\n",
    "1. [quickstart](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)\n",
    "2. [tutorial on RL](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Different from the Q learning in Section 2, we will implement Deep Q Network (DQN) in this section. The main differences are summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQN requires an experience replay buffer to store the transitions.** A replay memory (buffer) is implemented in the following `ExperienceReplayMemory` class. It contains a certain amount of transitions: `(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_t+1, done_t)`. When the memory is full, the earliest transition is discarded and the latest one is stored. The replay memory increases the sample efficiency (since each transition might be used multiple times) when solving complex task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQN has a delayed-updating target network.** DQN maintains another neural network called the target network that has identical architecture of the Q network. After a certain amount of learning steps has been taken, the target network copies the parameters of the Q network to itself. The update of the target network will be much less frequent than the update of the Q network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target network is used to stabilize the estimation of the TD error. In DQN, the TD error is estimated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(r_t + \\gamma \\max_{a_{t+1}} Q^{target}(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q value of the next state is estimated by the target network, not the Q network that is being updated. This mechanism can reduce the variance of gradient because the next Q values is not influenced by the update of current Q network.\n"

    "Unlike the supervised learning, in RL, the optimization objective, the episodic return, is not differentiable w.r.t. the neural network parameters. This can be solved via ***Policy Gradient***. It can be proved that policy gradient is an unbiased estimator of the gradient of the objective.\n",

Here the $r(\\tau)$ will be determined when $\\tau$ is determined. So it has nothing to do with the policy. We can move it out from the gradient.\n",

    "## Section 5: Policy gradient with baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "(20 / 100 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In REINFORCE, we compute the gradient of $Q = \\mathop{\\mathbb E} \\sum_t r(a_t, s_t)$ w.r.t. the parameter to update the policy. Let's consider this case: when you take an \"average\" action that leads to a positive expected return, the policy gradient is also positive and you will update your network toward this action. At the same time, there might be a potentially better action. You should update the policy toward the better action instead of the \"average\" action. Do we have any way to impose the idea that we should at least update the policy toward an action that is better than the literally \"average\" action?\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce the \"baseline\" when computing the policy gradient. The insight behind this is that we want to optimize the policy toward an action that are better than the \"average action\". We introduce $b_{t} = \\mathbb E_{a_t} \\sum_{t'}{\\gamma^{t'-t} r(s_{t'}, a_{t'})}$ as the baseline. It averages the expected discount return of all possible actions at state $s_t$. So that the \"advantage\" compared against the average action (aka the \"excess profit\") achieved by action $a_t$ can be evaluated via $\\sum_{t'=t} \\gamma^{t' -t}r(a_{t'}, s_{t'}) - b_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the policy gradient becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla_\\theta Q =\\cfrac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N [( \\sum_t  \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_{i,t}|s_{i,t}) (\\sum_{t'} \\gamma^{t'-t} r(s_{i,{t’}}, a_{i,t‘}) - b_{i, t})]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation, we estimate the baseline via an extra network `self.baseline`, which has same structure of the policy network but outputs only a scalar value. We use the output of this network to serve as the baseline, while this network is updated by fitting the true value of the expected return of current state: $\\mathbb E_{a_t} \\sum_{t'}{\\gamma^{t'-t} r(s_{t'}, a_{t'})}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The state-action values might have large variance if the reward function has large variance. It is not easy for a neural network to predict targets with large variance and extreme values. In our implementation, we use a trick to match the distribution of the baseline and values. During training, we first collect a batch of target values: $\\{t_i= \\mathbb E_{a_t} \\sum_{t'}{\\gamma^{t'-t} r(s_{t'}, a_{t'})}\\}_i$. Then we normalize all targets to a standard Normal distribution with mean = 0 and std = 1. Then we ask the baseline network to fit such normalized targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "When computing the advantages, instead of using the output of baseline network as the baseline $b$, we firstly match the baseline distribution (which, assume the baseline network is well trained, should be a standard Normal distribution) with the state-action values' distribution. We \"de-standarize\" the baselines. The transformed baselines $b' = f(b)$ should has the same mean and STD with the state-action values. By doing this, we mitigate the instability of training baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we compute the advantage of current action: $adv_{i,t} = \\sum_{t'} \\gamma^{t'-t} r(s_{i,{t'}}, a_{i,t'}) - b'_{i, t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: We suggest to normalize an array via: `(x - x.mean()) / max(x.std(), 1e-6)`. The max term can mitigate numeraical instability."
